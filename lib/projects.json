        "description": "Implemented and analyzed neural networks for handwritten digit recognition using MNIST. Compared softmax regression and multi-layer networks, exploring hyperparameters, momentum, regularization (L1/L2), and activation functions. Built forward/backpropagation from scratch and optimized with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent."
